    <h1>Michael Vaysfeld - A Student</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Michael Vaysfeld. I am a student in Staten Island Technical High School, and in the class of 2024. I have an older brother who is a big influence in my life. I like playing video games and exploring the infinite possibilities a computer presents, such as coding. I grew up playing video games. I enjoy listening to hiphop and pop music, specifically Kanye West. My favorite sport is hockey, and I am the fan of the New York Rangers, also known as the best hockey team in the world. I enjoy watching hockey with my family, and it really intrigues me when there are blockbuster trades.</p>
