    <h1>Michael Vaysfeld - A Student</h1>
    <h2>Who am I? What are my interests?</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Michael Vaysfeld. I am a student in Staten Island
      Technical High School, and in the class of 2024. I like playing video
      games and exploring the infinite possibilities a computer presents, such
      as coding. I grew up playing video games. I enjoy listening to hiphop and
      pop music, specifically Kanye West. My favorite sport is hockey, and I am
      the fan of the New York Rangers, also known as the best hockey team in the
      world. I enjoy watching hockey with my family, and it really intrigues me
      when there are blockbuster trades. My favorite TV show is "The Office
      U.S."", and I think Michael Scott is one of the best characters in modern
      television. I hope to have a lot of fun creating projects in class this
      year, and I hope to improve my knowledge of coding.
    </p>
